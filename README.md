<h1>WordPress Form Integration</h1>

<h3><a name="new-plugin">Contact Form 7 & Gravity Forms</a></h3>
<p>To integrate a Contact Form 7 or Gravity WordPress form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the WordPress plugin <a href="https://github.com/eci-lasso/wp-plugin/blob/main/lasso-bridge_1.9.zip" download>lasso-bridge_1.9.zip</a></li>
<li>Refer to the <a href="https://constructionsupport.ecisolutions.com/s/article/Lasso-Integrations-Integrate-Online-Form-Registration-Page-with-Lasso" target="_blank">Integrate Online Form (Registration Page) with Lasso</a> help article for instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the current plugin does not support multi-project submissions as each form uses a project-specific API key to submit data into Lasso.</p>
<p>If this is needed for a Contact Form 7 WordPress form, the legacy <a href="https://github.com/eci-lasso/wp-plugin/tree/main/legacy-cf7-plugin" target="_blank">Contact Form 7 to Lasso</a> plugin can be used instead. However, please note that this plugin is outdated and no longer supported.</p>
